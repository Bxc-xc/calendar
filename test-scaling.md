# Display Scaling Fix Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Added IPC Communication for Window Resizing
- **File**: `src/preload/preload.js`
- **Change**: Added `resizeWindow` function to communicate with main process

### 2. Updated Main Process to Handle Resize Requests
- **File**: `src/main/main.js`
- **Change**: Added IPC handler for `resize-window` that calls `mainWindow.setSize()`
- **Change**: Updated initial window dimensions to match default medium size (350x500)

### 3. Updated Renderer Process Size Management
- **File**: `src/renderer/app.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `setSize()` method to use numeric values and communicate with main process
  - Updated `enterFullscreen()` to resize window to full screen dimensions
  - Updated `stopResize()` to communicate manual resize to main process
  - Updated `loadSettings()` to apply saved dimensions to window

## How the Fix Works

1. **Before**: When user changed display size, only CSS container was resized, but Electron window remained fixed size, causing content truncation.

2. **After**: When user changes display size:
   - CSS container is resized (as before)
   - Renderer process sends IPC message to main process
   - Main process resizes the actual Electron window
   - Window and content are now properly synchronized

## Test Scenarios

1. **Size Button Changes**: Click small/medium/large/fullscreen buttons
   - Expected: Window should resize to match content
   - Expected: No content truncation

2. **Manual Resize**: Drag resize handles
   - Expected: Window should resize to match container
   - Expected: Content should scale appropriately

3. **Settings Persistence**: Restart application
   - Expected: Window should load with saved dimensions
   - Expected: No content truncation on startup

4. **Fullscreen Mode**: Double-click header or use F11
   - Expected: Window should resize to full screen
   - Expected: Content should fill entire screen

## Technical Details

- Uses Electron's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for secure communication
- Maintains existing CSS-based responsive design
- Preserves all existing functionality
- Adds proper window management for better user experience
